            <p class="psmall">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
                logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform
                generic
                sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
                tasks.
                A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system
                (main
                software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to
                a
                group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer
                cluster.A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or

                but use them to interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting
                language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of
                CSS
                defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of

            <p class="psmall">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles.
                It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).The ECMAScript standard does not
                include
                any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web

            <p class="pbig">This is a CSS</p>
            <p class="psmall">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
                layout,
                colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
                speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content
                also
                makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
